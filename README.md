# Social Media API 

## Description
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Installation
Make sure to have `node` installed. 

## Usage
Open up the project in VSCode, navigate to the root folder in terminal and use command `npm start` to start the server. Then open up Insomnia Core to implement tests using the proper routes.
